# Chess-CPP
This C++ project implements a chess game in the command-line.

## Build
Compilation uses CMake.
1. `git clone https://github.com/drd00/chess-cpp.git && cd chess-cpp`
2. `./build.sh`

## Run
Once compiled, run using `./Chess_run`.

## Outstanding issues (which I'm aware of)
1. For some reason, after a move is made, a string of `0` characters appears in the first line of the output, and I can't find what exactly is causing this.
2. En-passant capture is still not possible.
